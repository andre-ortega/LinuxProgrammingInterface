# LinuxProgrammingInterface

This is a folder containing many C files I have written in order to expand my C programming skills beyond 
what I've learned as an undergrad at OSU. The concepts learned in these files are analogous to those taught 
in the text that I am currently reading: The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk.

The makefile is also a continual work in progress.
