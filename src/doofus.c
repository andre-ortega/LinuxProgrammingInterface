// This is the first program I've written into the /bin directory, because after reading the simplified
//  source code for the cp command on page 71[115], I realized how easy it was to create my own commands.

//  Awesome :) Compile program w/ name "doofus", mv to /bin(using sudo), execute it with command "doofus".
